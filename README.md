# Finance Calculator

This finance calculator is a simple Python application that allows users to calculate either the interest they'll earn on an investment or the monthly repayments required for a bond (home loan).

## Features

- **Investment Calculator**: Calculates the future value of an investment given the initial deposit, interest rate, duration, and interest type (simple or compound).
- **Bond Calculator**: Determines the monthly repayment amount on a home loan based on the present value of the house, the interest rate, and the repayment period.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This script was developed using Python 3.8, but it should work with most Python 3 versions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TalhaHayat/InitialCapstone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```sh
   cd finance_calculators.py
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the Finance Calculator, execute:

```sh
python fiance_calculators.py
```

### How to Use

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to choose between calculating investment interest or bond repayments:

- Enter `investment` to use the Investment Calculator.
- Enter `bond` to use the Bond Calculator.

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required details for your chosen calculation. The calculator will then display the results directly in your terminal.
